# Extremes
Given an array, count how many elements in the array are equal to the maximal or to the minimal value of the array.

## Input
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing N: the number of elements in the array, followed by N integers: the elements of the array.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of elements in the array which are equal to the maximal or to the minimal value of the array.
