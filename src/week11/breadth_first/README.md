# Breadth First Traversal
For this activity, you will work with a Binary Search Tree. Your task will be to populate the BST with the integers that are provided as input and then to output the whole tree level by level. This means first outputting the root of the tree, then all of its children (left child first followed by right child), then all of their children, etc.

Any missing children produce no output.

Hint: The queue that you learned about in week 7 could come in handy. You don't have to implement your own queue, you can use one of the built-in Java ones such as ArrayDeque.

## Input
The first line of the input contains T: the number of integers to be inserted in the tree. Actual values follow.

## Output
Output one line containing all the values in the tree in the appropriate order.
